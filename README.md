## Emulator category in GNU/Linux menus for several emulators 

Files to get a new 'Emulators' category in GNU/Linux for several emulators you must previously get installed so that they run.

## Instalation
Just copy the entire tree in / as a root user but this README.md and .git folder.

## Add more emulators
Ask me about more emulators in Issues section.
Also you can follow this structure as a template to make your shortcuts in this category in your own emulator.
